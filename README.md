# numbers-to-words-czech
A simple python program to convert numbers to text representations of those numbers.
The main function is in the 'number_to_words.py' file and is called 'cislo_na_text'<br />
Usage: <br />
`cislo_na_text(10) -> 'deset'`<br />
`cislo_na_text(-999) -> 'mínus devět set devadesát devět'`<br />
`cislo_na_text(10**12) -> 'bilion'`

!Documentation is in Czech!<br />
**!The 'number_to_words - nechutno kod.py' file is a intentionally terribly written code that has the same function as the main 'number_to_words.py' file, don't use it, just admire its disgustingness!**

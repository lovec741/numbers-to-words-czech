# numbers-to-words-czech
A simple python program to convert numbers to text representations of those numbers.
Ex: 10 -> deset

!Documentation is in Czech!

!The 'number_to_words - nechutno kod.py' file is a intentionally terribly written code that has the same function as the main 'number_to_words.py' file, don't use it, just admire its disgustingness!
